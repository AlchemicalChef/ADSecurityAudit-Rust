\* TLC Configuration for DomainManagement module

SPECIFICATION Spec

\* Constants - small values for tractable state space
CONSTANTS
    DOMAINS = {corp, dev}
    MAX_AUDITS = 2

\* State constraint to bound exploration
CONSTRAINT StateConstraint

\* Safety invariants to check
INVARIANTS
    TypeInvariant
    SingleActiveDomain
    ActiveMustBeConnected
    AuditsOnlyOnConfigured
    AuditsOnlyOnConnected

\* BUG-5 DETECTION: These invariants will be VIOLATED
\* Uncomment to detect the race condition
\* INVARIANT AuditDomainConsistency
\* INVARIANT AuditContextPreserved

\* Note: AuditDomainConsistency and AuditContextPreserved are expected
\* to fail when using SetActiveDomainUnsafe (the buggy behavior).
\* The TLC counterexample will show the exact race condition scenario.
